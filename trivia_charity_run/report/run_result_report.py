        reached the finish (a split at km 10), with the columns:

        * id: the id of the runner (each row of a model needs a unique id)
        * runner_id, edition_id, bib, category, gender: from the runner
        * finish_time: the minutes between the start (split at km 0) and the finish (split at km 10)
        * pace: the minutes per km (the race is 10 km long)
        * rank: the rank in the edition, the fastest first; runners with the same time share
          the same rank (1, 2, 2, 4)
        * category_rank: the same, within the category of the runner

        Tips: EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM <interval>) gives seconds, and the window functions
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...) compute ranks.
